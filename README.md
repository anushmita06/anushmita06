# Hi there!
My name is Anushmita Dey, and I am currently a student at the University of Maryland, College Park!


## A little bit about me...
As a university student, I am majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics 📚. 
I am also an aspiring Software Engineer that is passionate about AI/ML, data science, and building meaningful tech solutions 💻.

  📍 Currently involved in [Break Through Tech](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/programs/the-ai-program/) and Cornell Tech's AI/ML Fellowship, exploring the development of machine learning models
  
  📍 Former Software Engineering Intern at the FDA and UI/UX Designer at U.S. News & World Report.
  
I am actively seeking internship opportunities where I can apply my skills, contribute to exciting challenges, and continue growing as a thoughtful and effective problem solver

## Project Experience 💡
### [Brain Tumor Segmentation Tool | Children's National Hospital](https://github.com/Pediatric-Accelerated-Intelligence-Lab)
Developed a full-stack web application for Children's National Hospital through the UMD App Development Club to enable real-time MRI brain tumor segmentation and visualization for clinicians. Integrated React frontend with OHIF viewers, Flask backend with deep learning models, and Docker Compose for containerized deployment across a 15-member technical team.

### [Navigating Healthcare Desserts Through Natural Disasters | Snowflake](https://github.com/soujanyakam/Snowflake1D)
Developed a two-stage ML pipeline (Random Forest + Gradient Boosting) to predict healthcare desert risk in disaster-prone Southeastern U.S. counties, achieving 82% storm classification accuracy and R²~0.80 for risk prediction. Built an interactive Snowflake-powered Streamlit dashboard with geospatial visualizations and Claude Sonnet 4.5 integration to enable targeted resource allocation for vulnerable communities.


###  [FaunaFlow, Animal Movement Tracking with AI | Technica](https://devpost.com/software/faunaflow-building-animal-observer-via-point-tracking)
Developed a computer vision pipeline during the Technica Hackathon to detect and visualize animal movement in video footage, leveraging SAM (Segment Anything Model) for segmentation and CoTracker for multi-frame tracking. Built an automated system that maps animal paths using color-coded trails to enable wildlife behavior analysis and movement pattern visualization.
