# Hi there üëã 
My name is Anushmita Dey, and I am currently a rising sophomore at the University of Maryland, College Park!


## A little bit about me...
As a university student, I am majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics üìö. 
I am also an aspiring Software Engineer that is passionate about AI/ML, data science, and building meaningful tech solutions üíª.
Currently, I am involved in [Break Through Tech](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/programs/the-ai-program/) and Cornell Tech's AI/ML Fellowship, exploring the development of machine learning models üß†.
I am looking for internship experience that will allow me to put my skills to use, as well as provide me with a place to grow as a problem solver!

## Project Experience üí°
### AI Studio ‚Äî Upcoming Industry Collaboration Project
A team-based program where I will collaborate with industry partners to solve real-world business challenges using machine learning. Once paired with a company aligned with my skills and interests, I‚Äôll work on large-scale datasets to train, test, and evaluate predictive models

###  [FaunaFlow ‚Äì Animal Movement Tracking with AI](https://devpost.com/software/faunaflow-building-animal-observer-via-point-tracking)
Built during the Technica Hackathon, FaunaFlow is a computer vision pipeline designed to detect and visualize animal movement in video footage. Using SAM (Segment Anything Model) and CoTracker, we tracked objects across frames and mapped their paths using color-coded trails.
